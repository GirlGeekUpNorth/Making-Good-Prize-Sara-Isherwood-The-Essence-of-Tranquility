    <img src="Forestoftheuncertiany.png" alt=" This art piece is from Sara Jade's Spoken Word which she created in lockdown from being self-isolated and called the Forest of the uncertiany. The scenery is very dark in theme, the path has bloches of greys and whites layered upon each other creating a 3D effect and a nice running pavement to follow into the dark uncertain woods. The trees are very rough in look, very chaotic looking plastered in black,
    green and white to give a rougher feel and look. There are beautiful dark red roses scattered along the path and were intentionally made to be 3D in look and show off the thorned-looking roses as it signifies protection and hidden softness to how Sara feels as herself but in a rose. And to finish the scenery there is a way of very dark clouds hovering above the trees and path to show how uncertain this forest is and where would this journey take us." class="image" width="200">
    <img src="Depression.png" alt="Sara did another quick acrylic art piece that was done in an impulse of how she felt in her Depression.
