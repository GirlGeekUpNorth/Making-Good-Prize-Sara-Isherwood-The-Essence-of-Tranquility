      <h1> Embrace our inner child </h1>

        <p>As adults, we have forgotten how to tap into our inner child because life gets so serious and harsh...
        I reckon we all still secretly want to be curious about "Oh, I wonder what it's like to just venture out to the forest, the seaside, and the northern lights..."
        Or, "Oh, I just want to scream, shout, dance in the middle of a crowd of people and be silly for just that glimpse of a moment, or give someone a spontaneous hug."
        We shamefully hush-hush those who play those childish games and throw them to the side because we are scared people will judge us, laugh at us, or think we are weird.</p>
        <p>Throughout childhood, we may have been punished or had secondhand embarrassment from teachers, bullies, parents, and friends due to showing sides of us that society wouldn't deem normal. We end up internalising their reactions and making them our own.
        So we hide our self-expression and have a facade of who we are to fit into what we think society wants us to be. This makes a lot of sense as to why we do it, as we are surviving to fit in. But in turn, we are abandoning the relationship to ourselves. As Carl Jung said "We judge what we do not understand" The concept of; we don't give ourselves time and space to be who we want to be because we have been taught to act in a certain way to fit into the mould of society thinks is less shameful. 
        However, in all honesty, people may judge us because they are scared to be themselves and you are reflecting the boldness they struggle to express themselves, they may feel inferior and to stop that feeling they judge, but isn't their fault just a deflection that we all do. No one likes to be vulnerable as it is terrifying. Most of the time no one cares and if they do it is just a reflection of parts of themselves they pushed away. So be brave and be you. 
        In accordance, without realising, we are stuck and miserable, and we don't like to admit it... But we are, and we don't know why we feel as we do... Maybe, this is because we aren't listening to ourselves, trusting our intuition, or knowing what we want or who we are. Maybe, we don't know what we want or who we are as society has conditioned us to look outwards versus inwards.. </p> 
        
        <h1> Philosophy, Psychology weighing Costs vs Benefits to life</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This is a costly way to live, as we are robbing ourselves of opportunities and risky growth experiences that are natural to go through in every stage of life, dimming our light, aliveness, and evolutionary humanness. Look at If you look at babies, children, and birds—all things nature—observe via body language and actions. You can see babies, they intuitively know, I must crawl and balance to walk, they fall 100 times and get right back up and don’t give up. This is a costly way to live, as we are robbing ourselves of opportunities and risky growth experiences that are natural to go through in every stage of life, dimming our light, aliveness, and evolutionary humanness.
        On this note of a career or in distressing circumstances, we wouldn’t know how to tender love for ourselves, bounce back, or sit with the tremendous grief of everything. The effects of these may cause us to feel like we are lost children, unsure of how to nurture ourselves and how to develop the intuitive nudge to go off and discover, play, and find ourselves.
        So in turn, we become passive in life as we feel helpless and may have a wave of deep, dark depression.
        It's very sad, as there aren't many places, tools, or know-how to manage these pains and turn them into passions.
        So, this can lead us into very painful habits or addictions that can destroy us mentally, emotionally, and financially, as it's a comfort to escape this world. It is dreadful, and no one deserves such emotional turmoil.
        So we get stuck in a paradoxical loop. </p>

         <p>Relationship to risk-taking and new .. Suppressing or even repressing our innermost passions in life...Stay stuck in the same tasteless routines... Deep-seated fear we wouldn't belong if we dared to pursue,
         For example, I want to be an Actor, as a teenager you kept pushing to pursue a different career and parents out of fear stopped you and now adult, we feel emotionally stunted repeating the same actions of moving job to job volunteering to other and not push to try new exciting risk such as go to university and pursue writing and stay miserable because it is the "safe option." Irony speaking.. probability speaking …. No matter what we do in life, everything has a cost. Would you rather live a life of ' safety' in which nothing is safe nor certain? There are huge consequences to staying safe versus taking risks and having opportunities to make new friends, life, got romantic relationships we thought we’d never have.. </p>

        <h4>“If suffering is inevitable, if our problems in life are unavoidable, then the question we should be asking is not “How do I stop suffering?” but “Why am I suffering – for what purpose?"
        "The Value of Suffering - To change how you see problems, change what you value and/or how you measure failure or success."Mark Mason </h4></section>
        
            
            
<p> All in all, We stay stuck in our prison of limted beilfs of " I can't do this and that" or "I'm too old or not strong enough or have no money" to feel same and certain.In the end,nothing is certain
no one stays in our lives forever, that certain job could end due to company shut down, house/flat maybe landlord decides to buy it off and we got to move out-- 
We didn't trust ourselves to let go of control and believe wait.. What if I just try that class tonight see how it goes.. Bam made a new friend -- though, we may create a new fear from previous painful expriences that " Ah, they'll get bored of em soon and leave me"
Maybe, you have a beilf of "no one likes me or I'm boring"-- So, we keep to our own self isolating routine and don't bother to try make new friends, or new class as it's too painful to 
face-- Trust me I see your pain deeply. It make sense why we beileve what we believe, these exprience's from past event was very painful.. but, we don't give ourselves
chance's to try X new place, food or trip as we think everything will crash around us. But, you see no matter what everything ends, crashes down anyway.. may aswell pursue what is exciting you--</p>
<h1>GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE </h1>

<p>Psychologist have said it takes 30 days to make a new habit.. imagine the benfits of baby stepping each day and try a new thing.. imagine what you can do
What if I told you , you can? This page is to show off all those inner childhood screams that we've repressed to come play 
If you'd like a place of safety, aliveness, fun, sponetous feelings -- you've come to the right place-
We don't have to be perfect, we can just be-- we can connect to our inner child and be free... </p>
